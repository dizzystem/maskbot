# maskbot
A discord bot for playing Turing Test Triangle.

Turing Test Triangle is a game about knowing your friends well enough to impersonate them. The game requires three players: a judge, a target and an imposter. When the game starts, the judge will ask questions at the target and imposter, while the target acts natural and the imposter pretends to be the target. (During this bit, the bot will mask their identities by anonymizing messages sent in DM into the channel.) After about ten minutes, the judge then makes a guess about who's the real one and the game ends.

Commands:
!imposter/!target/!judge - join the game as that role
!quit/!exit - quit the game, resetting all the roles
!fake <name>/!real <name> - guess that <name> is fake or real
!start - start the game!
